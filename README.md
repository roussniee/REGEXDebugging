<h2>Description</h2>
As part of a larger effort to automate the review of engineering blueprints, this project focused on debugging a Python script that parsed PDF blueprints using regular expressions. I collaborated with teammates to identify logic gaps and verify outputs before production rollout. Azure DevOps was used to track issues and document changes.
<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- Python (PDF and RegEx parsing)
- RegEx pattern testing and refinement
- Azure DevOps (issue tracking and version control)

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- Windows 11

<h2>Contributions </h2>

- Reviewed and debugged Python regex patterns to ensure accuracy across varied blueprint formats
- Tested edge cases using sample files and verified data extraction logic
- Logged issues and feature requests in Azure DevOps with reproduction steps
- Ensured the script could scale to handle hundreds of documents

<h2>âœ… Outcome</h2>

-  Improved accuracy and reliability of blueprint parsing logic
-  Contributed to smoother integration into document review workflows
-  Established version control best practices via Azure DevOps
